{"body":"# CPU EMULATOR\r\nThis application is a freescale 6808 cpu emulator. It will take in valid SREC files and display the appropriate contents within the grid. The user may also set switches and watch both registers and status flags! The user also has the ability to indicate how much memory they would like to have displayed within the grid.\r\n\r\n## High-Level Description\r\nOur application consists of 7 packages:\r\n\r\n### management\r\nThis package consists of a class which launches either the console or GUI based on the OS.\r\n\r\n### linux\r\nThis package consists of a class which manages the console user interface for the 6808 CPU emulator. It displays the CPU registers, CCR flag values, and the memory mapping. Functions include loading, resetting, and stepping among others.\r\n\r\n### windows\r\nthis package consists of a class that manages the graphical user interface for the 6808 CPU emulator. It displays the CPU registers, switches and the memory map. Functions include loading, resetting and stepping.\r\n\r\n### utilities\r\nThis package consists of three main files. These include FileIO, Srec, and UnsignedData.\r\n\r\n##### 1. FileIO\r\nIs a class created in order to handle reading in and passing along the SREC file for further processing.\r\n\r\n##### 2. Srec\r\nIs a class that handles parsing and validating the SREC file loaded in by the user.\r\n\r\n##### 3. UnsignedData\r\nIs a class which handles 'converting' the data types to unsigned versions - this is done by copying them into larger sized data types to avoid having the high bit used as a signed bit.\r\n\r\n### cpu\r\nThis package consists of a class which handles creating a virtual representation of a 6808 CPU. It contains attributes which map to the various registers of the CPU, and methods to get/set the register values.\r\n\r\n### emulator\r\nContains public methods to load the virtual memory with SREC data, and \"single step\" the emulator, which causes the emulator to process an instruction in memory based on the current CPU state and current memory values. Other methods allow one or two bytes of memory to be accessed, and the entire CPU object may be retrieved or set at any time. Private methods handle interpreting instruction opcodes and updating the CPU state.\r\n\r\n### test\r\nThis package was created for testing purposes. It was used in order to display the output of the application during our development phase (before the UI was completed).\r\n\r\n\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n` `\r\n\r\n[Back](http://tkurian-programming.blogspot.ca/p/6808-cpu-emulator.html)","google":"","tagline":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
